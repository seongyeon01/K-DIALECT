# K-DIALECT : Korean Dialect Interactive Agent for Linguistic Engagement and Conversational Text-To-Speech
Our demo page is released in https://dxlabskku.github.io/K-Dialect/

## Abstact
Dialectal variations within a nation can significantly hinder communication, underscoring the need for flexible speech synthesis systems. 
However, prior speech synthesis methods that modify speaker styles or use indirect features like embeddings often fail to capture the unique aspects of dialects. 
The limited availability of dialect speech data and the difficulty in separating speaker and dialect information further complicate the development of high-quality dialect synthesis. 
To overcome these challenges and achieve realistic dialect speech, we present a novel dialect speech synthesis system. 
This system offers an intuitive web interface for instant dialect conversion output. 
By integrating dialect sentence transformation and dialect-specific acoustic modeling, our system achieves both high quality and interactivity. 
This work opens new avenues for various voice application services, providing a strong basis for real-time interactive deployment.
